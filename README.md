#### The Meteor Chef
#### \#003 - Roll Your Own Authentication

In this recipe we'll be helping our client, Don Carlton, add custom
authentication to his sales management application. We'll make use of Meteor's
own Accounts Password package as well as several third-party OAuth services
like Facebook, GitHub, Google, and Twitter.
